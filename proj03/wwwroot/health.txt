MI5 Yugoslavia Project - Static File Checkpoint

Overview of Included Entities

In this dummy dataset, we have compiled 50 records blending real
 historical figures from the Yugoslav Wars (early 1990s) with fictional operatives
  and assets to simulate a British intelligence (MI5/MI6) database about two months after the peak of the conflict. 
  The data covers real political and military leaders, indicted war criminals, intelligence and paramilitary figures,
   as well as humanitarian activists and spies, each with an assigned affiliation and classification level. 
   We also include specific locations (cities, neighborhoods, and even cafes or safehouses) with country and currency information,
    reflecting the on-the-ground detail MI5 might track.

Fictional Assets and Operatives

To enhance realism, the dataset also features fictitious intelligence operatives, informants, and local assets:

MI6 agents (e.g. a field agent in Sarajevo posing as a journalist, and a station chief in Zagreb’s British Embassy) coordinating covert operations.

CIA officer in Sarajevo’s U.S. mission and GRU (Russian) operatives in Belgrade influencing Serb operations – reflecting the international spy presence.

Local informants like a Bosnian interpreter in Sarajevo and a Belgrade journalist secretly providing intel to the UK.

Paramilitary figures (fictional Serb warlord in Višegrad, a Croat HVO militia officer in Mostar, etc.) and organized crime bosses profiting from wartime smuggling.

Humanitarian and media personas (a Bosniak aid worker in Tuzla, a war correspondent, etc.) who serve as eyes on the ground.

Each fictional entry is crafted with a plausible Slavic or international name and placed at a specific locale (sometimes a neighborhood, hotel, or café rather than just a city) to mimic the granular detail of intelligence reports. For example, a hostile meeting spot is listed as “Hotel Moskva Café, Belgrade” – a known downtown location – and a British agent in Sarajevo is located at “Holiday Inn, Sarajevo”, the hotel where many foreign correspondents stayed during the siege. This level of detail aligns with real tradecraft, adding realistic texture to the dataset.
